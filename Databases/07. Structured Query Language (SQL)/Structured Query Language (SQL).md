# Structured Query Language (SQL)
## Questions

   1. What is SQL? What is DML? What is DDL? Recite the most important SQL commands.
   SQL (Structured Query Language) is a special-purpose programming language designed for managing 
   data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational 
   data stream management system (RDSMS).
    * DML - data manipulation language - Select, Insert, Delete, Update
    * DDL - data definition language - Create, Drop, Alter, Rename, Truncate
   2. What is Transact-SQL (T-SQL)?
   Transact-SQL (T-SQL) is Microsoft's and Sybase's proprietary extension to the SQL (Structured Query Language)
   used to interact with relational databases.

   T-SQL expands on the SQL standard to include procedural programming, local variables, various support functions 
   for string processing, date processing, mathematics, etc. and changes to the DELETE and UPDATE statements.

   Transact-SQL is central to using Microsoft SQL Server. All applications that communicate with an instance of SQL Server 
   do so by sending Transact-SQL statements to the server, regardless of the user interface of the application.
