Start Default.aspx for first task and second task.

Explain the "code behind" model.--->Microsoft recommends dealing with dynamic program code by using the code-behind model,
 which places this code in a separate file or in a specially designated script tag. Code-behind files typically have names
 like MyPage.aspx.cs or MyPage.aspx.vb while the page file is MyPage.aspx (same filename as the page file (ASPX), but with
 the final extension denoting the page language). This practice is automatic in Visual Studio and other IDEs however the 
 user can change the code-behind page. Also, in the web application format, the pagename.aspx.cs is a partial class that 
 is linked to the pagename.designer.cs file.
